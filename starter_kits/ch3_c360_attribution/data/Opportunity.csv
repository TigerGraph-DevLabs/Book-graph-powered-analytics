The data from the sensors in the long-haul trucks are in one cloud service, and the data from the sensors on the last-mile trucks are from another. The long-haul trucks delivers from the source (growers, processors, etc), to a distribution center and the last-mile takes from the DC to the end location (restaurants, stores, etc). In the future, there may be other data coming from other sources including third-party services (weather, traffic congestion, etc), and Hitachi?s own solutions on Azure cloud. These may also include different publish and subscribe messaging platforms such as MQTT.  Need to consolidate multiple schemas into one location. We don?t want to pay for cloud storage in multiple services so we?d like to store the data in one location. As the data source are not fixed (customers may already have specific services they use for the last-mile solutions, for example, or we may change solutions vendors), and we see the scope of the services expanding over time, it may make sense to have the consolidated data in a data lake type environment.  The predictive analytics platform will need to be able to take action on data-in-motion, potentially close to the sensors (in smart gateways, etc), and also process data-at-rest for machine learning and optimizing rules. Although this still needs to be defined, there is a need to tie together the process for device control and management across different services to provide a seamless view of the transportation end-to-end.  Other future applications (that are still to be defined) may need access to both the data-at-rest and data-in-motion. These may include mobile solutions for data query and data update (for example, adding information on action taken at the distribution center or restaurant, etc), bidirectional communication  with Field Service Management or CRM, etc. Other considerations for GraphSQL would be things like scalability, performance, flexibility but this is outside of the initial scope of this study.",Qualification,3,60000,10,6000,,2016-07-29,New Business,Sample Data Testing,,0,0,Pipeline,Pipeline,000000000000000AAA,,,005360000021cr2AAA,2016-05-16,005360000021cr2AAA,2016-05-23,005360000021cr2AAA,10/9/17 21:40,2016-05-16,2016-05-16,2016,3,,,,0,0,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

0063600000afCM3AAM,0,0013600001dGbpUAAS,0,VRG Corporation,"Harsha: Background:  Data Scientist, machine learning, business consultant, supporting projects.  Advanced Analytics team, part of IT org.  Managing machines and networks.  Support internal customers, 3 divisions: pharma, performance materials (liquid crystals), and life sciences.  2 years before, kicked of centralized data lake, big data capabilities.  Admitted they?re behind the competition.  Hadoop cluster in AWS, virtual private cloud, data from multiple sources, analytic capabilities.  Pull data from legacy systems, oracle systems, centrally stored and comes into data lake, follow governance process, data catalog.  Library of all the data.  Then we build project specific pipelines, based on business.  Use Tableau, spotfire, etc.    REsults .  Get request for NLP, text mining, using open source, machine learning.  Elastic search on the cloud.     Problem statement (pain):  End to end pipeline, there is a gap, end user has the data, but when they want to use analytics, have to work with data scientists and they have to build a custom solution each time.  Every time use engineers.  This is not efficient.  Now they?re investigating new opportunities is about graph databases.  Want to transform data they have into graph model and enable end users for self-service analytics.  End user can do analytics without data scientists in between.  Lightweight analytics can be done.      Comptetion:  Looking at neo4j and OntoDB and Tigergraph.  How could TG do their Vision?  Onto and Neo can't handle 10TB of data...    Process and timeline:  Not formalized timeline, trying to build centralized capability to sell to the business.  Build use-case scenarios to advertise internally.    None yet?investigating open source graph?define/decide solution to proceed by end of Q2?decide on technology and taken to the business partners.  Several activities in social media mining.     Budget for POC: $20-50k  Short activity for 20 business days of activities.  20-day POC get their approval and then expand it.    Use case?  Success?  Have a bunch of use cases, health care R&D and looking at public data from FDA and claims data.  They?re doing work to understand this data?one use case is to grab data and build graph structure and how could be a good starting point?  Looking for a POC.  Business partners are channel between core IT and the business.  Build capabilities and show to business partners and they messenge to the business.      Data schemes?  Anaylyzing market Scan data, range 5-6 TB of data last 5 years.  Multiple data sets and brought together, have analytics on top of it.  Overall around 10TB.  For POC, much smaller then that.    Ontology Format?  Open source Ontologies.  Public domain.    Software behind?  Data lake - stored as CSV and HDFS.  Source systems from oracle.  Put data in and dedicated pipelines.  Transforming csv files into claims files.  Multiple joins and machine learning, analyzed by end user.   Need graph capablelites?  Yes.        Can they collect and make accessible to the end user?    Advantage of Graph, use atop of data lake, require no programming skills, can go several layers down.    TG Advantage ; GSQL, semantic in nature.  More semantic then gremlin, analyst can have semantic mapping.    Tools?    Structured vs Unstructured data, use Python, etc.  Also have enterprise contract with SAP, SAP hanna.    Data in CSV format, convenient for Importing.  OntoDB is RDF graph, TB is an issue.      Would like to see demo of potential use cases, in reference to video on screen.  Self-Service use, how others use graph to help forming the use case in stronger way.    Victor/Abhi, any additional thoughts??  Also, I've copied his recent email here, likely demo end of February to help him define use cases:  As discussed during online meeting today:  As-Is situation: Attached  Reference to example public data sets which our R&D Pharma colleagues wish to analyze: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Surveillance/AdverseDrugEffects/ https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Downloadable-Public-Use-Files/SynPUFs/index.html   Perhaps during our next meeting or demo, we could touch on points below: 1. Given the As-Is situation, where does graph engine make most sense (Or, how could it fit into existing landscape)? 2. Given 2 reference data sets (you may have more), what could be a potential scope for pilot? 3. How could we achieve the vision ?Self-service analytics? ?  Something came to my mind after our call. Please could we have the demo + discussion session in the week starting from 25th Feb. We have a group event (Merck internals only) in week of March 05th where I could present benefits of incorporating graphs. This is a great opportunity to get buy in for PoC/Pilot.
